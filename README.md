# OS Hardening Security Incident Lab

## 🧩 Project Overview
In this project, I investigated a cybersecurity incident involving a cookbook website that experienced a performance issue and suspicious behavior after users visited the site.

By analyzing DNS and HTTP traffic logs, I discovered that the site redirected users to other domains. Further investigation revealed that the attack originated from a **brute force login attempt** performed by a former employee who used **default credentials**.
